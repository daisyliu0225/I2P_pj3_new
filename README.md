# NTHU I2P3   MiniChess AI

this is the final project for I2P2 course. It takes up 9 pts for the final score.

## What I did

the minimax method

the alpha-beta method:

## versions

### minimax version
Create repo <br />
The last one seem to crash and the way to access is way~~~ to troublesome <br />
--2023/06/17 12:30 AM <br />

Create minimax files and ensure it can move <br />
--2023/06/17 1:00 AM <br />

Write the minimax files and compile. <br />
It passed compiler but cannot move, it may be because of the evaluation <br />
--2023/06/17 10:22:20 AM <br />

Finished evaluation function <br />
--2023/06/17 11:15:19 AM <br />

Minimax bug problem fixed. <br />
I ignored the depth.QQ <br />
The version now can successfully beat the random player, but cannot beat the minimax player. <br />
Evaluation should be renewed. <br />

Depth of minimax is 5. <br />

### Updated evaluation function version
Update the evaluation function <br />
The last one may be too weak. I renewed the function by adding where the chesspieces are.

Update the evaluation function <br />
The last evaluation function is weak, though it can beat the random one, it cannot beat baseline2. <br />
Tried another function and it made draws with baseline2.<br />

## no-so-important-feelings

Why am I here doing this? <br />
I should be playing games and socializing with my friends now... <br />

<br />
I ate two meals of fast food. The clerk asked me why am I here. <br />
I said that I have to deal with my final project. She told me not to give up. <br />
--2023/06/17 <br />
<br />
I wandered around the school with my roommates because I cannot deal with the "Invalid action" problem. <br />
After wandering, I decided to go home. <br />
--2023/06/17 <br />
<br />
Cannot deal with the Invalid action and asked TA using eeclass. <br />
--2023/06/18 <br />
<br />
Finally found the problem!<br />
It is because I ignored the depth!<br />
Closer to finish the project!<br />
