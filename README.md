# NTHU I2P3   MiniChess AI

this is the final project for I2P2 course. It takes up 9 pts for the final score.

## What I did

the minimax method

the alpha-beta method:

## versions

### Create repo
The last one seem to crash and the way to access is way~~~ to troublesome <br />
--2023/06/17 12:30 AM 

### Create minimax files and ensure it can move
--2023/06/17 1:00 AM 

### Write the minimax files and compile.
It passed compiler but cannot move, it may be because of the evaluation <br />
--2023/06/17 10:22:20 AM

### Finished evaluation
--2023/06/17 11:15:19 AM

### Minimax bug problem fixed.
I ignored the depth.QQ <br />
The version now can successfully beat the random player, but cannot beat the minimax player. <br />
Evaluation should be renewed. <br />

### Depth of minimax is 5.

### Update the evaluation function
The last one may be too weak. I renewed the function by adding where the chesspieces are.

### Update the evaluation function
The last evaluation function is weak, though it can beat the random one, it cannot beat baseline2. <br />
Tried another function and it made draws with baseline2.

## no-so-important-feelings
Why am I here doing this?
I should be playing games and socializing with my friends now...
I ate two meals of fast food. The clerk asked me why am I here.
