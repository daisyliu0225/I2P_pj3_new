## What I did

the minimax method

the alpha-beta method:

## versions

### 2023/06/17 12:30 AM create repo
The last one seem to crash and the way to access is way~~~ to troublesome

### 2023/06/17 1:00 AM create minimax files and ensure it can move

### 2023/06/17 10:22:20 AM write the minimax files and compile.
It passed compiler but cannot move, it may be because of the evaluation.
- [x] finished

### 2023/06/17 11:15:19 AM finished evaluation.

### 2023/06/18 21:37:00 PM minimax bug problem fixed.
I ignored the depth.QQ <br />
The version now can successfully beat the random player, but cannot beat the minimax player. <br />
Evaluation should be renewed. <br />

### 2023/06/18 21:45:15 PM the depth of minimax is 5. 
- [x] renew evaluation.

### 2023/06/18 22:1741 PM update the evaluation function
The last one may be too weak. I renewed the function by adding where the chesspieces are.

## no-so-important-feelings
Why am I here doing this?
I should be playing games and socializing with my friends now...
I ate two meals of fast food. The clerk asked me why am I here.
